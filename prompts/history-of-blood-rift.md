The Blood Rift was created by the "blood magic" of **Queen Viro**, an ancient and ambitious magic-user. Zufa was ruled by her father, the Raja, who had twin daughters: **Lin** (gentle, a "heart") and **Viro** (fiery, a "hand"). Viro coveted the throne, but her father, fearing her ambition, passed her over.

Years later, a catastrophic magical drought (implied to be Viro's doing) ravaged the land. Queen Lin, now the ruler, met Viro at the mountain pass between their kingdoms. Viro offered to end the drought using **sanguimancy (blood magic)**, claiming it was the only way. The price, she revealed, was **Lin's own royal blood**.

Before Lin could agree, Viro betrayed her, revealing a hidden army and announcing she had already conquered Zufa's capital. To prevent Viro from completing her "taking" ritual and to spare her people a war, **Lin committed suicide** by leaning into a guard's sword.

Enraged that her ritual was foiled ("Blood magic works by *taking*, not *giving*"), Viro descended into "madness." She improvised by killing the guard and using *his* blood to unleash her magic. She "conjured... swaths of death," slaughtering *both* armies. The ground "heaved," and the "violent magic" tore the pass open, transforming it into the **Blood Rift**: a "wound in the earth, full of broken rock and lava flows."

The only living thing left was the **seedling** Lin had carried as a peace offering, which VLiro scoffed at. That seedling grew into the "majestic" oak tree that now creates the oasis in the center of the Rift.
