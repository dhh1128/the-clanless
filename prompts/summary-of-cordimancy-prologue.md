There is a prologue to Cordimancy that details the origin of the alliance between Gorumim and the osipi, forged more than a century before the events of *Cordimancy*.

### **What Happens in the Prologue**

The story follows **Gorumim**, a Sata, seeking an elder council of the osipi in the cold desert. He reveals his secret, true identity: **Moruvish, son of Kavek sa-Riga**, the rightful prince of Zufa, presumed dead after the usurper "Fodende" (ancestor of the current Raja) seized the throne.

To prove his worth and force them to listen, Gorumim employs two types of magic:

1. **Osipi Blood Magic:** He uses the **ash of a "born osipi"** he killed to grant himself the **"sensual acuity and reaction speed"** of an osipi. He challenges the osipi **cacique** (chief) to a duel.  
2. **The Duel:** Gorumim, enhanced by magic, fights the cacique "almost to a draw." He **intentionally loses** ("That was the plan") to gain an "honorable surrender" and is accepted as a "clan brother."

He then uses his "lip" magic (magic-infused speech) to enthrall the council and begins his seduction. He performs a second ritual, burning **powdered Sata blood** and having the osipi inhale the smoke. This grants them temporary **Sata-like endurance and immunity to the freezing cold**.

Gorumim promises them this is a taste of the future he can offer: the **"lifespan of a Sata"** without sacrificing their osipi "richness" of life. Deceiving them about the true, "evil" nature of his blood magic, he secures their "clan-bond" and loyalty for his long-term plan: a "well-timed coup" to reclaim his throne.

### **Relevance to *Cordimancy***

This prologue is critically relevant as it establishes Gorumim's entire motivation and the foundation of his conspiracy:

1. **Gorumim's True Motive:** It explicitly states Gorumim is **Moruvish, the rightful heir** to the throne. His "treason" in the novel is, in his eyes, a "well-timed coup" to reclaim his family's stolen crown from the "usurping tyrant."  
2. **The Osipi Alliance:** It explains *why* Luim and the *ahu* are allied with Gorumim. He "clan-bonded" with their ancestors generations ago. They are not mere mercenaries; they are his sworn "clan brothers."  
3. **The "Sata Lifespan" Promise:** It reveals the *exact* promise Gorumim made to the osipi, which Luim mentions in the novel: the **"glorious future"** of gaining Sata longevity while remaining osipi. This is the "utopic promise" driving their loyalty.  
4. **Gorumim the "Cheater":** The novel reveals Gorumim is a "lip" who "stole" Sata traits ("got this white hair from sata throats"). This prologue confirms it, *showing* him as a Sata who uses **"lip" magic** and **blood magic** (of *both* osipi and Sata) to mimic the abilities of all three races, confirming he "cheated the triple-forked path."
