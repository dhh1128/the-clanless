### **Introduction: The World of Sivanea, kingdom of Zufa**

The novel *Cordimancy* is set in the world of **Sivanea** and the **Kingdom of Zufa**, a pre-modern, pre-industrial society with a distinct cultural flavor analogous to that of the ancient Indian subcontinent (circa 2000 years ago). The society is organized around a feudal clan system, bound by loyalty to a central Raja, and defined by a deep and complex relationship with magic, history, and a rugged, mountainous landscape. The primary action takes place in the southern borderlands, specifically the **Sumago Mountains** territory of **Clan Kelun**, near the border of the osipi nation, **Merukesh**.

### **I. Geography & Environment**

The geography of Zufa is a primary antagonist, shaping its politics, culture, and isolation.

* **Topography:** The land is dominated by **high-altitude, rugged mountain ranges** (the Sumagos, the Kestrels), "high meadows," "narrow passes," and "deep ravines." Travel is arduous, slow, and dangerous, relying on "shaggy mountain ponies" and switchback trails.  
* **Climate:** The climate is seasonal, with cold, wet winters that are particularly lethal to the osipi, forcing their annual migration south. The highlands are temperate, while the lowlands (like the capital) are warmer.  
* **Key Locations (Civilization):**  
  * **Noemi:** The (now destroyed) ancestral home of Toril's parijan. It was a town built in a "saddle between two mountains" for strategic access to mines and pastures, centered on a fortified **durga**.  
  * **Bakar:** A major regional city in the south, serving as the headquarters for the Royal Guard. It was the site of Gorumim's "war council."  
  * **Sotalio:** A nearby town, home to the priest who married Toril and Malena.  
  * **Two Forks:** A critical river town built at the confluence of two rivers. It serves as a trade hub (managed by agents like **Corim**) and a crossing point (via ferry and dinghy). It houses a "prefect" and a "shimsal."  
  * **Kikal Pilar (The Capital):** The seat of the Raja's power, a large city built around a lake. It is the political, cultural, and (as Gorumim's target) magical center of Zufa.  
* **Key Locations (Mythic & Magical):**  
  * **The Blood Rift:** A "cursed," "evil" wasteland created by the ancient **Queen Viro's** blood magic. It is a "wound in the earth" filled with "broken rock and lava flows," "sulfur," and "noxious fog" that distorts sound, direction (compasses spin uselessly), and vision. It is populated by **pishachas** and is considered impassable.  
  * **Lin's Seedling (The Oasis):** A "majestic, hale, and symmetrical" oak tree at the center of the Blood Rift. It has created a magical "island of sunshine" with clean water, poppies, and life—a "refuge" that pushes back the Rift's "reeking, foul haze."  
  * **Kirte Fords (Naknar Kirte):** The "southern gate" to the capital province. This is a key magical boundary, the location of the "outermost enchantment" (or "tripwire") protecting the Raja.

### **II. Political Structure & Factions**

The politics of Zufa are a feudal hierarchy built on loyalty, tribute, and military obligation, which Gorumim has spent centuries infiltrating.

* **The Crown:** The supreme authority is the **Raja** (at the time of the novel, **Tónume**), who rules from **Kikal Pilar**. The Raja's power is absolute and magically protected by layers of **loyalty-based enchantments** around the palace, which are designed to make "treason" (even the *intent* of harm) impossible within its walls.  
* **The True History (The Usurpation):** The prologue reveals the current royal line (Fodende, Tónume) are **usurpers**. The *rightful* heir is **Gorumim**, whose true name is **Moruvish**, son of the true king **Kavek sa-Riga**. Gorumim's 200-year "loyal" service has been a "long con" to reclaim his "father's throne."  
* **The Clan System:** The kingdom is divided into semi-autonomous **Clans** (e.g., Clan Kelun, Pavilshani Clan, Navala Clan) who hold their territory in "fief" from the Raja.  
  * **Duties:** Clans owe the Raja tribute (implied) and, critically, **conscripts** for the Royal Guard.  
  * **Leadership:** A clan is led by a **Clan Chief**, whose symbol of office is a **clan totem**. This totem is not always a staff; the **Staff of Kelun** is merely the specific totem for Toril's clan.  
  * **Succession:** Leadership is usually hereditary but *can* be taken by **"challenge"** (as Toril did from Hasha). A challenge must be "witnessed" and is won when the vanquished "can draw his weapon nevermore" (which can mean death, maiming, or magical disarming).  
* **Parijans:** Clans are subdivided into **parijans** (family sub-clans). The leadership of a parijan is a potential stepping stone to becoming Clan Chief. This is the source of the **Rovin/Toril rivalry**.  
* **The Royal Guard:** The Raja's standing army, led by the **Lord Protector**, General Gorumim. They wear **scarlet sashes** and are responsible for border defense. They are the instrument of Gorumim's coup.  
* **The Sisterhood (The Voices):** A formal organization of magical communicators. They are supposed to be neutral but have been corrupted. The **Shimsals** (elite, "non-stop proxy" Voices) are key to Gorumim's plot, allowing him to be in multiple places at once and to control the flow of information (e.g., the Bakar twin and the Two Forks twin).  
* **The Conspiracy (Factions):**  
  * **Gorumim:** The "White Hair," the 200+ year-old Sata/Wizard and rightful heir, manipulating all events.  
  * **Rovin:** Toril's political rival. He allies with Gorumim to gain control of Clan Kelun, spreading the "osipi invasion" propaganda to justify his power grab.  
  * **The Osipi (Luim's Faction):** Gorumim "clan-bonded" with their ancestors generations ago, promising them Sata-like lifespans. They are his *ahu* army, not his prisoners.  
  * **The Shimsals:** At least two are in Gorumim's employ, acting as his agents.

### **III. History & Mythology**

Zufa's worldview is shaped by its gods and a central creation myth that mirrors the novel's core conflict.

* **The Gods (The Five Who Speak):** The gods are symbolized as the **five fingers of a hand**.  
  * **Gitám:** The "Unpaired One," symbolized by the **little finger**. Because the little finger is sometimes "neglected" when other fingers touch the thumb, he is the god of "dregs, lost causes, broken pottery, and orphans." He is also the god of marriage (Ch 3\) and personally guides Toril through his *kavro shilmar*.  
  * **Dashnal:** God of fire and war (associated with the Osipi path).  
  * **Karkita:** Goddess of wisdom, statecraft, and long life (associated with the Sata path).  
  * **Jurivna:** Goddess of spring, art, and poetry (Malena's secret patron).  
  * **Akeet:** God of craft and work (Jurivna's twin).  
* The Central Myth: The Origin of the Blood Rift:  
  This legend, told by Paka, is the thematic core of the novel. It details the conflict between the ancient twin queens:  
  * **Lin:** The rightful, elder queen. She was a **"Heart"** (like Malena/Paka) and was "gentle and generous," associated with nature, empathy, and peace (her **"seedling"**).  
  * **Viro:** The ambitious, younger twin. She was a **"Hand"** (a magic-user), associated with **sanguimancy (blood magic)** and power.  
  * **The Cataclysm:** Viro, coveting the throne, caused a magical drought. She demanded Lin's "royal blood" to perform a blood magic ritual to end it. When Viro's army betrayed and cornered Lin, Lin **committed suicide** to deny Viro her "taking" ritual (as "Blood magic works by *taking*, not *giving*").  
  * **The Rift:** Viro, in a "madness," used a proxy's blood instead, unleashing a "swath of death" that slaughtered *both* armies and "tore" the land, creating the Blood Rift.  
  * **The Seedling:** The only thing to survive was Lin's seedling, which grew into the "majestic" oak in the Rift—a symbol that **"Heart" magic (Cordimancy/sacrifice) outlasts "Hand" magic (force)**.  
* **Other Lore:**  
  * **First Man:** A story told by Gitám during Toril's ordeal, explaining that humans *forge* their "true names" through *choice*.  
  * **Raja Oreni:** A "black art" legend about a king who used self-torture and debasement to gain the power to *possess* the bodies of animals (and later, humans). This is the origin of Gorumim's **oreni** (wolforen).

### **IV. Culture & Society**

The culture of Zufa is a blend of practical, harsh, high-altitude living with deep-seated ritual and tradition.

* **Social Structure:** A feudal, clan-based society with a clear hierarchy: the Raja, clan chiefs, parijan heads, agents (Corim), soldiers, artisans (Paka/Shivi), servants (Kinora), and "urchins"/beggars.  
* **Marriage & Family:**  
  * Marriages are often **arranged** for political/social gain (Malena's "prestigious offer").  
  * **Bride Price:** Paid by the groom's family to the bride's (Toril sent horses, jewelry, books, and a harp to Malena's family).  
  * **Antechild:** A private, symbolic gift from the *wife to the husband* at the time of marriage (e.g., Malena's personally-made ocarina and ceramic daisy). This is a *personal* exchange, distinct from the political/economic "bride price."  
  * **Heartstone:** A *secret* and "taboo" gift given by the husband to the wife upon **consummation**, symbolizing their union. It is often deeply personal (Toril hand-crafted his from turquoise over many years).  
* **Child-Rearing:**  
  * **Fosterage:** It is common for children (like Tupa, age 11\) to be sent to "fosterage" with "near parents" (like "Erim's household") for education and to build political/social alliances.  
* **Daily Life:**  
  * **Food:** Staples are practical and hardy. **Millet cakes**, **baati** (dense bread), **ghee** (clarified butter), dried venison, **goat cheese**, **naan**, roast lamb. Foragable food includes raspberries, "bark-bonnets" (mushrooms), and prickly pear cactus. A common drink is *kalu*.  
  * **Architecture:** Buildings are made of **adobe** and **stone** with **thatch** roofs. The central strongholds are called **durgas**.  
  * **Clothing:** Traditional attire includes **saris** (Mam), **kurtas** (tunics), **shalwar** (pantaloons), and **kirtles** (a simple tunic for girls like Kinora).  
  * **Music:** Instruments mentioned include the **oud**, **dulcimer**, and Paka's **sitar**.  
* **Rituals & Beliefs:**  
  * **Naming Day:** The central rite of passage where an adolescent chooses one of the "three paths" (Human, Osipi, Sata).  
  * **Naming Ceremony:** A two-part ceremony.  
    1. The **"use-name"** is given by the mother.  
    2. The **"self-name"** is "chosen" by the initiate, who is guided by **quattroglyphs** (patterns of four stones) found in a bag of rocks.  
  * **Funerals:** Death is treated with reverence. The body is **cremated** on a **pyre**. This is seen as the "natural" cycle ("Fire and ash, life and death were a circle"). Ashes are then scattered or interred in a **burial garden** at the *paoro*.

### **V. Language, Terminology, & Hostile Beings**

* **Cultural Roots:** The terminology (e.g., *durga*, *rakshasa*, *pishacha*, *kirtle*, *sari*) is explicitly rooted in the cultures of the ancient Indian subcontinent.  
* **Hostile Beings (Non-Human):**  
  * **Rakshasa:** A "giant, tusked, scaly monster" of immense strength. One was "bound" by Gorumim's magic and used in the Noemi attack.  
  * **Pishachas:** "Beetle-like," tusked, multi-armed humanoids that inhabit the Blood Rift. They ride "suvars" (savage boars) and hunt in "herding" packs.  
  * **Oreni / Wolforen:** Not a separate species, but *human spirits* (Gorumim's slaves) who, through the "black art" of Raja Oreni, *possess* the bodies of animals (like the supernatural wolves).  
* **Key In-World Terms:**  
  * **Ahu:** An elite osipi warrior who wears an *ivona* (battle collar).  
  * **Aiki Ahu:** A *legendary* osipi warrior (Oji, Luim) who can use the Aiki trance.  
  * **Cacique:** An osipi chief (Luim).  
  * **Durga:** A fortified stronghold.  
  * **Kada:** A storyteller/bard (Paka's former training).  
  * **Kitar:** The osipi's primary weapon. It is a blade held "above an osipi's fist" and is used as a **jabbing/stabbing weapon** for lightning-fast thrusts, not for cutting or slashing.  
  * **Kavro Shilmar:** The "Ordeal of Names," a "great magic" ritual with Gitám.  
  * **Paoro:** A combination church, school, and town hall.  
  * **Parijan:** A sub-clan within a larger Clan.  
  * **Quattroglyphs:** Patterns of four stones used for divination/naming.  
  * **Shimsal:** A high-level, "non-stop proxy" Voice.  
  * **Suvar:** The "bristly, savage" boars ridden by pishachas.  
  * **Tanga:** A horse-cart or stable.  
* Magical Language (Linguistic Rule):  
  A core linguistic rule defines the nature of magic in Zufa:  
  * **Good Magic (Cordimancy):** The magical language of "good" incantations (like healing or protection) is dominated by **voiced consonants** (e.g., /b/, /d/, /g/, /v/, /z/, /ʒ/).  
  * **Evil Magic (Sanguimancy/Dark):** The magical language of "evil" incantations (like Gorumim's torture spell) is dominated by **voiceless consonants** (e.g., /p/, /t/, /k/, /f/, /s/, /ʃ/).  
* **Magical Language (Sample Incantations):**  
  * **Good (Voiced):** Zujizgæ, gizro enazhegúv goa mabizher (Toril's spell to disable Hasha's hand). Dægezhív izíg (Toril's "breathe easy" healing spell). Buómævi ñumai’irozh, munjúviliz e vo\! (Toril's resurrection spell).  
  * **Evil (Voiceless):** Shatashík moku’opi sana ar\! (Gorumim's torture spell for Toril's mouth).
