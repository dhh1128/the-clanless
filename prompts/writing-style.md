This is an excellent set of questions. The "how" of a story is just as important as the "what." Based on the text, here is a reference guide to the writing style, tone, and authorial choices of *Cordimancy*, designed to guide AI collaboration.

---

### **1\. Overall Tone and Prose Rhythm**

The novel's tone is **Grounded Literary Fantasy**. It is serious, intimate, and psychologically focused. The prose is "close" to the characters, prioritizing their internal emotional and sensory experiences over high-octane, external action.

* **Prose:** The narrative voice is **educated, precise, and evocative**. It does not use overly "purple" or flowery language, but it is not simplistic. It employs a rich, specific vocabulary (e.g., *incongruous, cathartic, paroxysm, ephemeral, insidious, acrid*). The focus is on finding the *exact* word for a complex emotion or sensation.  
* **Rhythm:** The rhythm is **measured and confident**. It is not breathless. It balances complex sentences—which are used to explore internal thoughts, memories, and ethical dilemmas—with short, declarative sentences to provide impact, finality, or a shift in action.  
* **Focus:** The narrative is "internal." The greatest conflicts are psychological. The prose is more interested in *why* Toril feels guilty than in the *mechanics* of his sling. It is more interested in the *sensation* of Malena's trauma-trigger than the physical act of her escape.

### **2\. Point of View (POV)**

The novel uses a **Strict Third-Person Limited POV** that rotates between key characters (primarily Toril and Malena, with Kinora providing a third perspective).

* **Deep Immersion:** When in a character's POV, the narrative is *fully* embedded in their head. We hear their thoughts, feel their physical sensations (Toril's magic on his *lips*, his physical depletion; Malena's *nausea*, her triggers), and see the world *only* as they perceive it.  
* **No Head-Hopping:** This is a crucial, inviolable rule. The narrative *never* reveals the thoughts or feelings of another character within a POV chapter. We only know what the POV character can see, hear, or *assume*.  
* **Purpose:** This strict separation is the primary engine for **dramatic irony and misunderstanding**. The reader knows Malena is traumatized, but Toril (from his POV) only sees her as cold and rejecting. We know Toril sacrificed his magic, but Malena (from her POV) initially sees him as "crippled" and "foolish." The sequel must maintain this "wall" between POVs to build realistic conflict.

### **3\. Diction and World-Building**

* **World-Building Integration:** The novel's con-lang and cultural terms (*durga*, *kavro shilmar*, *pishacha*, *kitar*, *ahu*, *paoro*) are integrated **seamlessly without exposition**. The text *never* stops to explain what a word means. The meaning must *always* be derived from context. (e.g., We know a *durga* is a fort because characters defend it; we know a *kitar* is a weapon because Oji fights with it).  
* **Sensory Language:** This is a key stylistic signature. The prose is saturated with sensory details beyond sight.  
  * **Smell:** Oji's osipi senses (smelling Malena's perfume on Toril), the "sulfur" and "mold" of the Rift, the "acrid" smoke of Noemi.  
  * **Touch:** The "clammy" cold of the river, the "prickle" of magic on Toril's lips, the "gritty" sand in the Rift.  
  * **Sound:** The "disorienting" voices in the Rift, the "raspy, accented voice" of Luim, the "whistle" of an arrow.  
* **Magical Language:** Incantations are distinct. "Good" magic (healing, protection) uses **voiced consonants** (e.g., Buómævi ñumai’irozh...), while "evil" magic (Gorumim's torture) uses **voiceless consonants** (e.g., Shatashík moku’opi...).

### **4\. Dialogue Handling**

Dialogue is **naturalistic but purposeful**. It is never "filler."

* **Tags:** Dialogue tags are "invisible." The primary tag is **"said."** Flashy verbs ("exclaimed," "opined," "interjected") are avoided. More often, tags are replaced with **action beats** that reveal a character's internal state.  
  * *Example:* Malena’s eyes narrowed. “I don’t want to talk about it.”  
* **Subtext:** The most important part of the dialogue is the *subtext*. What a character *says* is often in direct conflict with what they *think* (their internal monologue).  
* **Character Voice (Dialect):**  
  * **Toril & Malena (High-Status):** Speak in full, articulate, educated sentences. Their internal monologues are complex.  
  * **Shivi & Paka (Common/Wise):** Speak in a "folksy," warm, and direct manner. They use more contractions. Their wisdom is practical, not academic ("My old bones...").  
  * **Oji (Osipi):** His speech is "lilting, rapid-fire." His sentence structure is slightly clipped and direct, reflecting his accelerated thought process. He uses osipi terms naturally.  
  * **Gorumim (Performative):** His speech is archaic, "bard-like," and formal. He *lectures*, *recites*, and *performs* rather than converses, using speech as a tool of magical and psychological control.

### **5\. Handling of Sensitive Content (Show vs. Tell)**

The author makes deliberate choices to focus on the *impact* of violence rather than the *act* itself. This is a core part of the novel's "dignified" tone.

* **No Swearing:** This is a firm rule. Characters express extreme emotion (anger, despair) through *physical action* (Toril beating a branch, Malena's "wail"), *sharp dialogue*, or *visceral internal monologue*, but never profanity.  
* **Malena's Trauma (The "Implied" Act):** The narrative *never* depicts the sexual assault. This is a "Tell, Don't Show" choice, but it is more of a "Show the *Aftermath*" choice.  
  * **Mechanism:** The horror is conveyed *entirely* through its psychological fallout. The narrative shows the moments *before* (hiding in the barley) and the *immediate after* (waking up, her "victim" monologue in Ch 10).  
  * **The Focus:** The "on-screen" event is not the rape; it's the *trauma*. We are shown:  
    1. **The Trigger:** Her panic at Toril's gentle touch ("Get your hands off me\!").  
    2. **The Spiritual Violation:** Her feeling of being "soiled on the inside" and her association of this with the *oren's* attempted *possession*.  
    3. **The Disgust:** Her "compulsion to purge" her body of "filth" at the well.  
  * **Why this works:** This approach **respects Malena's dignity** and the reader's sensibilities. It refuses to make the violence voyeuristic. It correctly identifies that the *true* story is not the act, but the *survival* and the *agonizing journey of healing*. The sequel must *always* treat this trauma with the same respect, focusing on the psychological echoes rather than graphic flashbacks.

### **6\. Flashbacks and Memories**

The novel does not use traditional, full-chapter flashbacks. Instead, memories are **active, internal monologues** triggered by a present-tense event.

* **Malena remembering the ocarina** is triggered by her anxiety over the *antechild*.  
* **Toril remembering his mother's grief** is triggered by his *own* choice at the river.  
* The **"Ordeal of Names"** (Ch 28\) and the **"Legend of the Rift"** (Ch 46\) are presented as *in-world stories* (a divine lesson and Paka's *kada* tale), not as simple narrative flashbacks.

**Rule for AI:** All memories must be brief, psychologically motivated, and firmly rooted in the POV character's current emotional state.
