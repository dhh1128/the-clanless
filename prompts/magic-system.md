Names of magic are associated with body parts using Greek roots. Thus, "manu" \+ "mancy" \= hand magic, "labimancy" \= lip magic, "cordimancy" \= heart magic, sanguimancy \= "blood magic", etc.

All human magic originates from "The Five Who Speak" (gods) and is determined by a choice made during the **Naming Day** ritual.

### **1\. The Middle Path (Human)**

This is the default path, chosen by most humans. It results in a normal human lifespan. Some ordinary humans use magic and are called "Kindlers".

* **"Heart" (Magic-less):** The most common outcome. These individuals are "duds" with no ability to "kindle" innate magic (e.g., Malena, Paka). They can, however, use learned skills (like Malena's **herbalism/botany**) or mundane skills (Paka's sleight-of-hand) to produce practical, quasi-magical effects.  
* **"Kindler" (Magic-User):** A minority who receive a focused magical endowment. These include:  
  * **Lip (Labimancer):** (e.g., Toril, former). Wields magic through spoken **incantations** (e.g., `Maurozh!` for death, `Dægezhív izíg` for healing, `Bulen zhová!` for fire).  
  * **Hand (manumancer):** (e.g., Shivi, Hasha). Wields magic through tactile focus (weaving, sculpting, illusions).  
  * **Ear (akomancer) / Voice (phonimancer):** (e.g., the Sisterhood). Wields magic for long-distance communication.  
* **Cost:** Using innate magic, especially healing, is "exhausting" and "plumbs the life force" of the Kindler.

### **2\. The Path of Fire (Osipi / Half-Life / Hakufu)**

This path, associated with the god Dashnal, involves fully embracing magic, but losing most ability to consciously control it, as it takes over the person.

* **Biology:** Individuals are either "Born osipi" (e.g., Oji) or "Chosen" (human converts, e.g., Amar). They live on an accelerated 6:1 biological and mental timeline (e.g., Oji is an adult warrior at 13).  
* **Abilities:** Possess superhuman senses, including the ability to **see in ultraviolet** light ("speckled lilies").  
* **Weakness:** They have an extreme, often lethal, vulnerability to **cold**.  
* **Magic (Aiki Ahu):** Elite warriors (like Oji and Luim) can enter an **"Aiki trance"** for superhuman combat speed. This "burns up" their life force, causing a subsequent feverish collapse. Osipi "Aiki blood" (especially after a trance) has potent, life-saving magical properties.

### **3\. The Path of Ice (Sata)**

This path, associated with the goddess Karkita, requires the user to **"renounce all heart fire"** (magic).

* **Abilities:** Gain extreme **longevity** (200+ years).  
* **Cost (The Renunciation):** The price for long life is severe sensory and biological deprivation.  
  * They are **sterile** ("stoneless").  
  * They are **colorblind** (see only in **grayscale**).  
  * Their senses are muted: "taste-immune," "temperature-immune," and "music escapes them."  
* **Magic (Status):** They are "magical cripples" and **cannot "kindle"** innate magic.  
* **Magic (Wielding):** Sata *can* wield magic via proxies (wizards, blood magic) or by triggering **"Lingers"** (magic-infused objects, e.g., Gorumim's horn).  
* **The Exception (Gorumim):** Gorumim is a "cheater." He is a **"lip" (wizard)** who *stole* Sata longevity ("got this white hair from sata throats") and is *not* bound by their inability to use magic.

### **Special Magical States**

* **Kavro Shilmar (Ordeal of Names):** A "great magic" ritual with the god Gitám. Toril **sacrificed his "lip" magic** to begin it. He then **"unwove" his body's bound magic** (costing his **fertility** and physical strength) to gain resurrection power (used on Malena and Hika).  
* **Oreni:** Spirit-possessors (Gorumim's slaves) who "mortify" their bodies to possess animals (wolves, rakshasa).  
* **Sanguimancy (Blood Magic):** Universally considered evil, because it works by taking blood from others. Used by Gorumim. Requires "annihilation" (e.g., Noemi) or "fresh blood from the Crown" (the children) for massive rituals.
