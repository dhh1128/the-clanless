### **Part 1: The Naming and the Nuptials**

**Chapter 1: boy on naming day \~ Toril**

The novel opens with **Toril**, the young son of **Hasha**, chief of **Clan Kelun**, undergoing his Naming Day. This is a magical rite of passage where an adolescent chooses one of "Three Paths." The ordeal involves walking into a river and holding one's breath until "the magic comes."

Toril is ambitious. He seeks the **Path of Ice**, the way of the **Sata**—long-lived, magic-less, emotionally "colorless" philosopher-generals. He hopes to emulate a clan ancestor, **Irov ur Hapno**, who became a Sata and brought prosperity and knowledge to his people. Toril dreams of leaving to see the world and returning with wisdom to lead his clan.

As he nears suffocation, the magic of the **Path of Fire** comes to him first. It's an ecstatic, overwhelming power that makes him feel "urgently alive." He finally understands his older brother, **Amar**, who chose this path and became one of the **"half-lives"** (the **Osipi**), living an intensely accelerated, short life. This path is associated with the god **Dashnal**. However, the memory of his mother’s grief over Amar—who recently died of old age, childless, breaking the line of succession—is too strong. Guided by empathy for his parents, Toril actively *rejects* the fire, calling on the goddess **Karkita** for help.

He then attempts the Path of Ice (Karkita's path). The ordeal is one of *extreme* pain. He recalls his mother's desire for grandbabies (which Sata do not have) and his own ambition. But the pain is too great. His body rebels, and the "fire defying cold" proves he cannot renounce the magic.

Defeated, Toril gives up both supernatural paths and surfaces, conceding to "the middle path" (Human). He emerges with **blisters on his lips**, the mark of a focused magical endowment. He is a **"lip"** (a **labimancer**, or magic-user who kindles through speech).

In the final part of the ceremony, he must find his "self-name" in **quattroglyphs** (patterns of stones). His father, Hasha, points out glyphs for "fire," "home," and "heart," but Toril, feeling it "incongruous" with his ordeal, rejects them. Instead, he finds a name in his own broom strokes: **"Seeker."** He then finds a complex, secondary glyph in the pebbles: **"Helpless"** or **"of the Helpless."** He claims his true name, given by the god **Gitám** (the god of "dregs, lost causes... and orphans"): **"Seeker of the Helpless."**

**Chapter 2: the antechild \~ Malena, a decade later**

The narrative jumps "a decade later." **Malena**, from the **Line of Shavir**, arrives with her family at the **durga** (fort) of **Noemi** to marry Toril. Toril's mother has died, making Malena the prospective new clan mother.

The central conflict is twofold. First, Malena's father is obsessed with her producing an heir quickly to secure their family's political alliance, as Toril is Hasha's "one remaining son." Second, they fight over the **"antechild,"** a symbolic, private gift from the wife to the husband.

Her father demands she give the **Shavir signet**—a valuable, politically significant heirloom (a man's ring with an emerald). He wants a public symbol of the alliance.

Malena refuses. Her chosen antechild is "amateur pottery": a **ceramic porcelain flower** and a **cracked, worn ocarina**. She argues that the "bride price" (horses, jewelry, books) came *from Toril himself*, not Hasha, and he is the one she is marrying. Her gift is personal, not political.

**Chapter 3: interruptions \~ Toril**

The wedding ceremony is interrupted by a "Voice" (a magical messenger) with an urgent summons from **Gorumim**, the "Lord Protector of the Realm" (a Sata), calling Hasha to a **"war council"** in **Bakar** *tomorrow* to discuss "Osipi incursions."

Toril leaves his own feast to join his father, revealing Hasha is gravely ill (coughing blood, "nagging illness"). Toril uses his "lip" magic to cast a costly healing spell, Dægezhív izíg ("breathe easy"), which leaves him "exhausting" and "plumbed the life force."

They deduce Gorumim's summons is a political power play. Gorumim *knows* Hasha is too sick to make the short-notice journey. By not attending, Hasha would be forced to "pass the staff" (the clan's **totem** of leadership) to his political rival, **Rovin**.

To thwart this, Hasha orchestrates his *own* succession. He has Toril **"challenge"** him for the **Staff of Kelun** with the Voice as a formal witness. A challenge is won when the vanquished "can draw his weapon nevermore." Hasha, whose magic is "hand"-based (slow, weak, requires sculpting clay), chooses "magic" as the weapon.

Toril, a powerful "lip," casts a permanent, non-lethal spell: Zujizgæ, gizro enazhegúv goa mabizher ("Fingers, may you always itch with magic"). The spell works, giving Hasha an uncontrollable "itch" that makes him unable to focus or "kindle" his magic ever again. Toril wins the challenge.

When he takes the **Staff of Kelun**, he *alone* sees a magical **"linger"**—"whorls of flame-colored light"—that forms the words: **"Hold your name."** Toril, now officially the **Chief of Kelun Clan**, swears the oath ("A staff of service, not of tyranny") and prepares to ride to Bakar in his father's place.

**Chapter 4: a feast and stable \~ Malena**

At the feast, Malena feels ambivalent about her arranged marriage, though she clings to a "hint of kindness" from a childhood memory. Years ago, when Toril was in fosterage, Malena broke a **ceramic ocarina**. Toril found her, mended it, and left it on her pillow with a **daisy** poked through a finger hole. This is the inspiration for her chosen antechild.

After the feast, Toril demands they leave. Malena's request to say goodnight angers him, and he stalks off to the stables. Malena finds him in travel leathers, saddling his horse, with the **Staff of Kelun**. He explains his father's illness and the entire political situation, including his "challenge" to become chief.

Malena, revealing she is "a good judge of people," delivers a "feeling": she saw **Gorumim** once as a child and her "skin started to crawl." She is *certain* he is **"evil"** and "dangerous," and pleads with Toril to "avoid antagonizing him."

Toril kisses her and rides off. Alone, Malena reveals *her* naming day secret: the quattroglyphs showed **"labor"** and **"heart"** (a "dud"). She saw this as a "prediction of misery," so she **"swept the rocks away"** and secretly dedicated herself to **Jurivna** (goddess of art).

Later, she meets **Kinora**, a 7-year-old "urchin." She learns **Toril personally hired Kinora** after hearing her sing in the market, saving her from an abusive stepfather. When Kinora shows Malena to her new chambers, Malena finds a fresh **daisy** on her pillow, left by Toril, confirming he remembers.

### **Part 2: The Conspiracy and the Massacre**

**Chapter 5: stonecaster \~ Toril**

Toril and a page ride to **Bakar**, late for the council. They are drawn by a leopard's growl into a ravine. Toril, revealing his skill as a **"stonecaster,"** kills the leopard with his sling, whispering the word **"Maurozh\!"** (Death) to magically augment his shot.

The leopard's victim is **Oathizhi ("Oji")**, a young adult **osipi** tied to a tree. He is a "healer trained" but also wears an (empty) **ivona** (battle collar). Toril tends to Oji's wounds, starting a fire with an incantation and using a healing spell that leaves him "swaying on his feet."

Oji reveals the *entire conspiracy*. He was tied up by his own osipi band on the orders of their cacique, **Luim**. The entire situation is a **"charade"** orchestrated by **Gorumim**. Gorumim's plan is to have Luim's band "consent" to be "captured." Gorumim will then "invent some mischief" to blame on them to "inflame the clan chiefs" and start a war. Oji objected to this "madness," fought Luim (how his arm was broken), was branded a traitor, and left to die.

**Chapter 6: sisters \~ Malena**

Malena wakes alone in her new chambers. Her 11-year-old sister, **Tupa**, visits, distraught over her upcoming **fosterage** at "Erim's household." With Malena gone, Tupa feels she will be "so lonely." Malena comforts her, promising they can "talk by **Voice**" (a form of magical, long-distance communication). Tupa leaves with her parents for their journey home.

**Chapter 7: war council \~ Toril**

Toril arrives at the war council at the Royal Guard's HQ in **Bakar**. The **Shimsal** (a high-level "proxy" Voice) speaks for the absent Gorumim. She dismisses Toril as a "boy." Toril stuns the council by announcing: **"I am Toril ur Hasha, chief of Kelun Clan... I took the staff by challenge."**

Gorumim's ploy unfolds. He claims the **osipi** are planning a "full-blown invasion." **Luim** and his warriors are brought in, manacled, as "proof" they were "ambushed" and "captured." Toril, knowing Oji's story, sees this is a lie.

Gorumim demands a vote on a pre-emptive war. Toril is the *only* one to object. He argues the plan is illogical ("guaranteeing their own starvation") and inhumane. He proposes diplomacy: "an offer of food."

Gorumim dismisses Toril's "idealism" and "cowardice." All other clan chiefs vote "yes" for war. Toril stands alone and votes **"no."** He accuses Gorumim of engineering the crisis ("rumors... not proof"). In response, the Shimsal, claiming the authority of the **Raja**, orders the guards to detain Toril in a "place where he can ponder."

**Chapter 8: sacks of barley \~ Malena**

Back in Noemi, Malena smells smoke. She and the durga's **Voice** go to a terrace and see the town is on fire—a coordinated attack. The Voice is immediately **assassinated by an arrow**, cutting off the durga's communication. Malena realizes the fire is a distraction.

She runs to warn **Hasha**, but the main gate is breached. The attackers are **bandits** (tattooed, filed teeth) and a **rakshasa** (a giant, tusked, scaly monster). The battle is a massacre. Malena sees **Hasha struck down by the rakshasa's club**.

In the chaos, Malena sees one bandit riding **Tupa's pinto horse**. The horrifying implication is that her family's traveling party was ambushed *before* the attack on Noemi. Cut off from the tower, Malena flees to the **stable** and hides among **"sacks of barley."** From her hiding place, she overhears bandits confirming the **rakshasa is controlled by a "spell"** that "wears off at midnight."

**Chapter 9: smoke \~ Toril**

**Oji** (now recovered) breaks Toril out of his "prison" room in Bakar. He reveals he eavesdropped on the council: Gorumim announced that **"Noemi had been attacked and overrun"** by **osipi**. Oji knows "he is lying."

Toril steals a horse and rides through the night. He arrives at Noemi to find it a "graveyard." The scene is one of total slaughter. He finds the "cooper's shop" burned with the **corpses of children** inside, which causes him to vomit. He senses the "magic lingers" of the dead—an "audible resonance" from an "ear" and "rippling discolorations" from the "hand" (the Voice).

In the durga's courtyard, he finds **Hasha's body**, deformed by the rakshasa's club. He searches his ransacked chambers, finding **shards of her ceramic pottery** and her bridal sari, bloodied and defiled.

He follows his dog, **Hika**, to the stable, where the **rakshasa** traps him inside. He fights it, using an incantation, Bulen zhová\!, to set straw on fire. The beast (now blind in one eye) pins his leg. As it lunges to kill him, Toril braces the **Staff of Kelun**, and the monster impales itself through the throat and brain.

He finds **Malena** unconscious behind the grain sacks, "half-covered with a torn shift," with a "deep gash near the sternum," and covered in bruises.

---

### **Part 3: The Price of Magic and the Pursuit**

**Chapter 10: victim \~ Malena**

Malena wakes in her bedchamber, with Toril asleep on the floor. She is consumed by **severe psychological trauma**, feeling "soiled on the inside," "shame," and "guilt" (survivor's guilt for hiding). She is horrified by the memory of "being pinned to the floor" and the "eyes or hands on your body."

She tries to sneak away to "curl up and die," but falls and wakes Toril. When he gently lifts her, she is **triggered** by his touch and has a panic attack, screaming, **"Get your hands off me\!"**

Toril, shocked, confirms she is the only survivor and his father is dead. Malena lashes out at him in her pain: "How dare you say you understand\! You were off slapping backs... You felt no eyes or hands on your body." She ends by telling him, "You should have let me die... There were no survivors here."

**Chapter 11: riders \~ Toril**

**Vasari**, a man from Clan Kelun, arrives with a dozen riders. He reveals the full extent of **Rovin's treachery**:

1. Rovin is spreading Gorumim's lie that **osipi** attacked Noemi.  
2. He is claiming Toril's chieftainship is illegitimate ("no witnesses," "used magic to force Hasha").  
3. He is painting Toril as a "coward" who "ran away in disgrace" from the war council.  
4. Rovin ordered them to "take the staff" from Toril.

Toril, enraged, refuses to surrender the staff. Vasari, trusting Toril, stands down. Just as they are speaking, **Shivi** and **Paka**, an elderly couple (a weaver and his midwife/healer wife), arrive, having survived in their cottage outside town. Shivi, an experienced healer, takes over Malena's care.

**Chapter 12: White Hair \~ Kinora**

The perspective shifts to **Kinora**, who was *kidnapped* by the bandits. They hand her and \~28 other children over to **Royal Guard** soldiers led by **Gorumim** (White Hair). Gorumim is revealed as the terrifying, in-person mastermind. He demonstrates his power by using a **magical linger** in his **silver-capped horn** to remotely **suffocate** an insolent bandit.

Most critically, Kinora overhears his true motive. The massacre was a *failed ritual*. "My wizard needs **annihilation**... a symbol to spark a specific magic." The ritual failed because "one heart is still beating... A woman's heart, at the very center of the durga." Malena's survival *broke the spell*. Gorumim's osipi ally (who calls him "brother Gorumim") mentions they need to use **"blood magic"** to finish the job.

**Chapter 13: pyres \~ Toril**

Toril is trapped by an impossible choice. **Shivi** confirms Malena is dying: the wound "doesn't smell right" (infected). **Vasari** insists Toril must *leave* Malena and come to Sotalio *now* to fight Rovin for control of the clan ("My people before myself").

Toril finally connects all the dots for Vasari: Gorumim's "prisoners" were a lie, Gorumim *knew* about the attack instantly (proving complicity), and therefore **Rovin and Gorumim are allied**.

Toril explodes. He *chose* duty by going to Bakar, and it led to this disaster. He **refuses to abandon Malena a second time.** He tells Vasari: "Tell Rovin I challenge him. Here." Vasari, furious at this "cowardice," abandons him. As they leave, a magical, "unnatural" storm begins, and Toril decides to "fight back with magic of my own."

**Chapter 14: kavro shilmar \~ Toril**

Toril declares his intent to perform **kavro shilmar** (the "Ordeal of Names"), one of the "great magics," to save Malena. Shivi warns him, "all magic has a price."

He meets the **priest** (who stayed behind) at the *paoro*. He begins the ritual, **sacrificing a parchment scroll** (containing his vow/request) by burning it. The priest is possessed by **Gitám**.

Gitám shows Toril a vision of **First Man**, explaining that "Naming is creation" and "Choosing is how a name is forged. Speakers cannot choose for you."

In the ordeal, Toril is plunged into total darkness. Gitám asks his name. Toril chooses: **"Healer-of-Malena."** He sees a "tiny rose-colored pinpoint" of light, which then vanishes. He has *failed*.

A **"black mist"** (a *new* magical threat, separate from the storm) flows into the durga.

Gitám's voice returns. He explains *why* the name failed: "Healer-of-Malena" cannot be a true name. "Does love demand that Malena take the name 'Healed-by-Toril' so you can have the name you want?" Toril understands: healing is *Malena's* choice, not his to force.

Gitám prompts Toril, reminding him of his naming day. Toril re-claims his original, humble name: **"I am... seeker-of-the-helpless."** His body jolts with warmth. Gitám accepts the name: "Yes. That is a good name for you... Now the ordeal begins again."

**Chapter 15: shadows \~ Malena**

The **"black mist"** flows into Malena's room, causing Shivi and Paka to fall into a magical sleep. The mist **possesses/kills Malena**, forcing her spirit out of her body. In this "alert and whole" spirit-form, she has supernatural senses.

She watches Toril and the priest return. Toril, having just completed the *kavro shilmar*, kneels by Malena's lifeless body. He utters an incantation: Buómævi ñumai’irozh, munjúviliz e vo\!

Malena (as a spirit) sees a **"bluish luminance"** (magic) stream from Toril's mouth into her corpse. The "dark shadow" (the mist) is violently expelled. She is pulled back into her body, **resurrected** and **completely healed**. The moment she is revived, Toril **"slumped to the floor,"** unconscious.

A flashback to the ordeal reveals the full price. Toril's "sacrifice" (burning the scroll) cost him his **"lip" magic**. Gitám then offered him a new covenant: "Would you covenant now to **unweave**" the magic "woven into your body" to accomplish his purpose? Toril accepted. This "unweaving" is what he used to resurrect Malena.

**Chapter 16-19: The Pursuit**

Toril revives, but is "wan and depleted"—his new magic has left him physically weak. The **priest has fled**. The group (Toril, Malena, Shivi, Paka, Hika) decides to flee Noemi. They discover Vahunira's body (a murdered child) left by the bandits. A goatherd then confirms the bandits **kidnapped "lots" of the children**.

Malena, trusting her "feeling" that her sister Tupa is among them, insists they pursue *now*. Toril, knowing he is magic-less and needs help, wants to go to Sotalio. This creates a new "impossible choice." Remembering his mother ("Boys and birds matter more"), Toril *relents* and **follows Malena** into the wilderness.

At their first camp, Malena uses her **botany** ("book learning") to find **Bromavis**, an herb that has a magical healing effect on Paka's swollen ankles. Shivi uses her "hand" magic to create an illusion, turning chickweed into **"daisies"** to comfort Malena. Paka, a "cordimancer" ("heart"), explains that their true magic is kindness and skill.

---

### **Part 4: The Hunt and the Rift**

**Chapter 20-21: The Oreni**

The camp is attacked by **"wolforen"**—supernatural, possessed wolves. They ignore the others and focus *specifically* on **Malena**. Toril is wounded (a deep bite on the thigh). The dog **Hika** is **killed**. Just as the wolves corner Malena, **Oji** arrives in an inhuman "blur" and kills them.

The moment a wolf dies, Malena feels a "horrible dissociating sensation" as the **"alien, malevolent other"** (the wolf's spirit) tries to *possess* her. Shivi explains the **Legend of Oreni**, an evil raja who mastered this "black art" of possession. Hika *convulsed* and "drowned herself" to *escape* possession after being bitten. Toril, off-screen, **resurrected Hika** with his new power.

Oji reveals he has been tracking the children. The bandits were "slaughtered by ahu" (osipi). The children are now captives of the **Royal Guard** and Gorumim's **osipi allies**. Oji also reveals **Gorumim *is* the wizard**.

**Chapter 22-24: The Confession**

Toril struggles to start a fire, and Malena impatiently tells him to **"Use your magic\!"** Toril finally breaks and confesses his secret: **"I'm not a lip... Not anymore."** He explains he sacrificed his magic in the *kavro shilmar*. Malena is horrified—"how are we going to rescue the children?\!"—and Toril snaps that this is *why* he wanted to go to Sotalio for help, but *she* "wouldn't listen."

Toril breaks down, confessing his guilt that *his* "pride" at the war council is what "took it out on Noemi." Malena, feeling betrayed and furious, stalks away. Later, **Toril's kindness** (preparing her bed with **hot stones** and **dry footwraps**) and **Shivi's counsel** ("Do not give up on joy") begin to thaw Malena's anger. Oji reveals he is **13 years old** and that **Sata (like Gorumim) see only in grayscale**, while osipi can see in ultraviolet.

**Chapter 25-30: Two Forks and the Trap**

The group (now trusting each other) reaches **Two Forks** to get help. Toril, Malena, Shivi, and Oji are ambushed by the **ahu**. The *ahu* reveal **Luim is Oji's father** and offer him a deal: **kill Malena** and rejoin his clan. Oji *chooses* his new family. He enters an **"Aiki trance"** and **fights three *ahu* alone** while Toril (with his **sling**) and Hika fight the fourth. They win, but Oji collapses, "burned out." Shivi reveals their son, **Nanar**, was an osipi, which is how she knows the culture.

Toril and Malena ride ahead to Two Forks. The town is fully under Rovin's/Gorumim's propaganda. When a sergeant repeats the lies, Malena **publicly and fiercely defends Toril's honor**, stunning him. They are *captured* by the **Bakar Shimsal's twin**.

**Shivi** (a powerful "hand") and **Paka** (a "cordimancer" acting as a guard) orchestrate a brilliant escape. Shivi uses her magic to **disguise Malena as the Shimsal**. Malena walks out. Paka and Toril (in a potato cart) escape. The group reunites outside town, where **Oji** (with Hika) has rescued **"Cricket,"** the catatonic toddler Kinora hid in the rushes, by feeding him his **"Aiki blood."**

Their escape is cut short. *Ahu* scouts are on their trail. The **Staff of Kelun** gives a new command: **"Cut across."** They are forced to enter the **Blood Rift**. Toril is **shot with an arrow** as they flee.

**Chapter 31-45: The Blood Rift**

Inside the "cursed" mist, Kinora's **"help" quattroglyph** (Ch 27, 29\) alerts them to a **trap**. Guided by Toril's "feeling" (Gitám's guidance), they *avoid* the *ahu* ambush by **floating down the river**. They crash. Toril saves Malena, but **Paka** (dying of cancer) confesses he *kicked Shivi* away in his panic. Toril and Oji rescue Shivi, and Oji confirms they successfully bypassed the trap.

They find **Lin's Tree**, the oasis in the Rift (Ch 46). Paka tells the legend of **Viro's** blood magic creating the Rift.

Toril, misunderstanding Malena's trauma, offers her his **heartstone** (Ch 47). Triggered, she *throws it into the mist*. Horrified, she runs after it and gets lost. She confronts her secret **pregnancy** from the assault (Ch 48). The group, now holding Toril's *staff*, gains **supernatural shared vision** (Ch 45\) and finds her, but they are attacked by **pishachas**. **Paka is mortally wounded** by a spear. Malena uses the staff as a *lever* to cause a rockslide. They make a desperate climb and **escape the Rift**.

---

### **Part 5: The Ordeal and the Resolution**

**Chapter 46-50: The Final Sacrifice**

The group (Toril, Malena, Shivi, Oji) emerges from the Rift. They find a **blood magic ritual site** (Ch 49-50): Gorumim has **sacrificed four of the children** to "twist" the "tripwire" enchantment at the **Kirte Fords**.

**Paka dies** from his spear wound. They build a funeral pyre, placing the children in his arms "like a grandpa." Shivi, now a widow, is consumed by "fierce" vengeance and reveals she **knows a secret shortcut** to the capital, **Kikal Pilar**.

**Chapter 51-54: The Capital**

Malena, consumed by guilt, tries to **run away**. Shivi confronts her in the river (Ch 51), delivering a powerful speech on *forgiveness*: "It’s refusing to let the darkness have the final say... **and then it chooses to love anyway.**"

They infiltrate the capital (Ch 52-53). They are ambushed on their **rooftop hideout**. Toril **sacrifices himself** ("Remember, they want you\!") to let Malena escape. Malena is knocked unconscious.

Malena wakes alone (Ch 54). She finds Gorumim's *tanga* (stable) and overhears him **torturing the captured Toril**.

* **Gorumim's Plan:** He will kill the Raja at the **Harvest Festival reception (tonight)**. He will use the *ahu* to kill the guards and the *children's blood* ("a pair of children for each \[shield\]") to break the Raja's "protective shells."  
* **Gorumim's Nature:** He is a **"lip"** (wizard) who **"got this white hair from sata throats,"** *stealing* Sata longevity.  
* **Toril's Final Secret:** Toril, under torture, reveals he *sacrificed* his magic in the *kavro shilmar*. When Gorumim mocks him, Toril whispers his last secret: the *kavro shilmar* *also* took his **fertility** ("Sata fork... already stoneless").  
* Gorumim, enraged, **burns Toril's mouth and lips mute** (Shatashík moku’opi sana ar\!) and leaves him for dead.

**Chapter 55-56: The Climax and "Cordimancy"**

Malena frees the mutilated, mute Toril. They go to the reception. Gorumim begins his coup. **Malena wields the staff** and attacks. **Oji** arrives in a "golden streak" and intercepts **Luim**; they begin an *aiki* duel.

Gorumim **sacrifices his first child victim** (a girl) and *drinks her blood*. He fires a **bolt of plasma** at Malena.

Toril **intercepts the bolt with the Staff of Kelun**. There is a massive explosion. Gorumim's magic *fails* and **recoils** into him. The entire palace, overloaded with the "tangled" magic, **implodes and collapses**.

**Resolution:** In the "peace" of the ruins, Malena gathers the survivors. **Oji** emerges with **Kinora** and *his* group of children. Then, **Toril** limps up, supporting **TUPA** (who is alive) and another child.

Malena embraces Toril—**"And she hugged him back."**

Tupa reveals the final truth: the girl Gorumim sacrificed was **SHIVI**. Shivi had *used her illusion magic to impersonate Tupa*, taking her place.

Toril (mute) realizes *this* is what broke the spell. Gorumim "tangled with a heart... had a mind and a power of its own." Malena understands *this* is **"Cordimancy"** (heart-magic): the power of *sacrifice* (Paka, Oji, Toril, and Shivi). Tupa gives Toril **Paka's heartstone** (a simple acorn). Toril, "stoneless" and "mute," holds it out to Malena, and she **smiles**.
