This is a fantastic layer of complexity. Making Rovin's wife Malena's sister makes the Sotalio conflict deeply and painfully personal. It provides the perfect "pressure cooker" to force Malena's growth.

Here is how we can weave these new elements into her arc to add the richness you're looking for.

## 1. The Sister: The "Perfect" Foil

Your sister character (let's call her Elara) is the ghost of Malena's past. She *is* the "Shavir signet"; she represents the "social climbing and political power" her parents valued.

* **Worldview Tension:** When Malena arrives, Elara's reaction will be a mix of pity and profound **shame**. Malena is a walking scandal: disgraced, "widowed," and "scandalously pregnant". Elara will "help" by trying to *hide* Malena, to manage her, to keep her quiet so she doesn't jeopardize Rovin's political standing.
* **The "Help":** Malena's "demand for help" will be for the *orphans*. Elara's "help" will be for *Malena's reputation*. This is the central conflict. Elara will say, "Rovin will find a place for the children, just stop making a scene." Malena, remembering Shivi, will be horrified by this cold, political "solution."
* **The Marriage Contrast:** Elara has everything Malena was *supposed* to want: power, status, a "Clan Chief" husband. But Malena, in her "strict third-person" POV, will see the truth: the marriage is a hollow, "transactional" alliance. Elara's "strength" is just her husband's status. This will, as you note, make Malena "love, appreciate, and trust Toril more". She sees that her "battered", "stoneless" husband is a "true partner" who *listens* and *shares* his helplessness, a level of "deep emotional intimacy" her sister will never know.

## 2. The "Shivi" Arc: Becoming the Heart

Malena's "stress" is the engine for her growth. She is not a natural mother; she is a "practical artist".

* **The "Labor" and the Stress:** The 6-week journey and the time in Sotalio will be *hard*. The orphans are traumatized. They hoard food, they have nightmares, they fight. Malena, also pregnant and traumatized, will be "stressed out" and overwhelmed. She will find herself snapping at a child, her patience worn thin.
* **Internalizing Shivi:** In that moment of failure, her internal monologue will be her turning point. She will hear **Shivi's** voice: "Forgiveness... chooses to love anyway". As you said, she will **catch herself repeating** Shivi's and Paka's practical wisdom. This is her "becoming Shivi-like"—not by being perfect, but by *choosing* to be patient, *choosing* to try again, *choosing* Cordimancy.
* **Corim's Sister (Desta):** Your idea to bring in Corim's sister is perfect. Let's call her Desta. Desta is practical, "labor"-focused, and helps manage the logistics of the children. This creates a new "trio" of women: **Malena** (the "Heart" and Healer), **Desta** (the "Labor"), and **Kinora** (the "Voice"). Desta's presence frees Malena from just being a babysitter and allows her to become the clan's *emotional* center.

## 3. Added Richness: The Healer and The Artist

We can add two more layers to complete her journey from the "Seeker" of art to the practitioner of "Cordimancy".

### The "Dud" Who Heals the "Lip"
Toril, the great "lip" healer, is now "mutilated" and "magic-less". This creates a powerful, intimate role-reversal.

* **Her True Magic:** Malena's "magic" is her **herbalism/botany**. On the journey and in Sotalio, it is *her* practical, "dud" skill that she uses to tend Toril's healing, "burned mute" mouth.
* **Intimacy:** This act is a direct confrontation with her "hands" trigger. In *Cordimancy*, she couldn't bear his touch. Now, *she* must be the one to gently touch his face, his lips, to apply salves. This practical act of healing *him* is the final step in healing *herself*, cementing their "deep emotional intimacy".

### The "Labor" as Her True "Art"
Malena's original quest was for **Jurivna** (goddess of art). She saw "Labor" and "Heart" as "misery".

* **The Final Temptation:** In Sotalio, when she sees her sister Elara's life of leisure—perhaps Elara even has the *harp* Toril sent as Malena's bride price—Malena will feel a final, sharp pang of *resentment*. She will mourn the "artist" she never got to be.
* **The Resolution:** Her "Labor" (the birth of Paka) and her "Heart" (her new "Clanless" family) are the resolution. She will realize that *this* is her true "art." Molding a "dud" existence into a life of purpose, healing a broken man, and *creating* a new, safe clan from "dregs, lost causes... and orphans" is the greatest act of creation. It is the ultimate **Cordimancy**.
