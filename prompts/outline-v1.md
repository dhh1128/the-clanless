You're absolutely right. The 41-point list is the skeleton; this next pass is how we give it a "Heart".

This is the "real work", and I'm ready. We will weave the quiet, "intimate" scenes of healing and bonding in between the major plot points to ensure the reader "fall[s] in love" with this family.

Here is the expanded scene-by-scene list, built from our 41 "chapters" and infused with the "emotional meat" you've requested.
