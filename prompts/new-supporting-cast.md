## New Supporting Cast Dossiers (The "Who")
This document outlines the new, crucial supporting characters created for The Clanless.

Veshumi: Malena's older sister.

Role: Malena's primary antagonist in Sotalio.

Status: Married to Rovin's cousin.

Motivation: Defined by "social climbing" and a "barren" marriage. Her grief over her parents' deaths manifests as a desire to protect her family's political status. She is "jealous" and "resentful" of Malena's "scandalous" (but fertile) pregnancy.

Desta: Corim's sister.

Role: A key "Clanless" ally; represents the "Labor" aspect of the new clan.

Status: A practical, capable woman who joins the group to help manage the orphans.

Motivation: Loyalty to Corim and a practical sense of duty. She becomes Malena's friend and confidante, allowing Malena to be the "Heart" rather than just a manager.

Nima: The local Sotalio "Voice".

Role: A "refugee in plain sight" who becomes the "Clanless" group's "Voice."

Status: A "sympathetic" "Voice" operator, not a high-level Shimsal.

Motivation: Her friend was the Noemi Voice murdered by Gorumim's forces. She knows the Sisterhood is compromised. Kinora's testimony and the intercepted "Gorumim is alive" message force her to abandon her post and join the exile for her own survival.

Kael: An ahu (Osipi warrior).

Role: Oji's companion and "second witness".

Status: A survivor of the Kikal Pilar massacre whom Oji saves.

Motivation: He was not in Luim's inner circle. He provides the crucial "witness" testimony of Luim's treachery (sabotaged pass, burned stores). He becomes Oji's "first friend" and loyal follower, validating Oji's new leadership.
