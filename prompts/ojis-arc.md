This is a fantastic line of questioning. Oji's arc needs to be just as strong as the others, and you've hit on the perfect way to tie it directly into the main plot, making Rovin's "fake war" tragically and ironically real.

Here is a proposed arc that incorporates your ideas and aims for maximum emotional impact.

## 1. The Compelling Reason (The "Whisper")

You are right; "shame" is not enough to make Oji leave. He needs a *mission*. He gets it in the ruins of Kikal Pilar, just as he's recovering.

* **The "One Defector":** Your idea of a defector is perfect. As Oji recovers, he fines *one* other *ahu* survivor, Kael.
* **Luim's True Treachery:** Kael provides the mission. He reveals Luim's "madness" was worse than Oji knew. To force the Osipi migration north (which they resisted due to the lethal cold), Luim **sabotaged his own people**.
    * He had his loyalists (the ones who *were* evil) trigger a rockslide, **collapsing the main pass** back to their homeland, **Merukesh**.
    * He **burned the winter food stores** in the southern Sumago Mountains.
    * He then **blamed this on humans**, claiming a human army was "scorching the earth" and blocking their way home.
* **The Mission:** This was Luim's "long con" to force *all* Osipi—warriors and civilians alike—to depend on Gorumim for survival, driving them north. The dying *ahu* tells Oji, "My family... the elders, the children... they are *trapped* in the southern mountains. They have no food. No way home. They are... *helpless*."

This gives Oji his "Helpless Seeker" call to action. He must part with Toril because Toril's mission (wagons, children) is *slow*, and his is a desperate *race against time and starvation*.

## 2. The Emotional Journey (Atonement)

His internal state is defined by **atonement and honor**.

* **Haunted by Parricide:** He is "haunted" by killing his father, Luim. This act has made him the *de facto* "cacique", but he feels the title is poisoned.
* **What Keeps Him Going:** His motivation is not shame, but **rectifying honor**. His father betrayed the *clan* (the families, the "helpless"). Oji, by saving them, is *redeeming* his father's title. He is *atoning* for his father's sin by saving his father's victims.
* **Toril as Anchor:** He "doesn't have Toril by his side", but Toril is his "found brother" and his moral compass. His "personal honor" code is now defined by what Toril would do. He isn't just saving "Osipi"; he is saving *innocents*, just as Toril would.

## 3. The Tragic Loop (Rovin's "Real" War)

This is where Oji's arc brilliantly connects to the Sotalio plot and the "skirmishes".

* **The "Clanless" Osipi:** Oji travels south at Osipi speed. He finds his people. They are not an army; they are **starving refugees**—the families, elders, and children Luim abandoned.
* **The Skirmishes:** These desperate, starving Osipi are the ones **raiding human settlements** (like those in Clan Kelun's territory) for food.
* **Rovin's "Proof":** These raids are what Rovin is seeing. The "skirmishes" are *real*. Rovin's "fake war" has become a self-fulfilling prophecy. He sees the "Osipi invasion" and uses it to "cement his power", sending troops to hunt down the very refugees Oji is trying to save.
* **The Race:** Oji's mission is now twofold:
    1.  He must find food for his people.
    2.  He must *protect* them from Rovin's "war" patrols.

He is "clanless" and his people are "clanless." He is failing. By the time he meets Toril at the Blood Rift, it is his last, most desperate act. His people are freezing and being actively hunted. The Rift, a place of "evil", is the only "refuge" Rovin's troops won't follow them into.

This is the perfect place to deepen Oji's arc. He's been defined by his honor, his power, and his "traitor" status; now he must be defined by his *responsibility*.

Here’s a breakdown of his emotional journey, the ironies, and the power of the final meeting.

### Oji's Emotional Journey (From Son to "Cacique")

Oji is "haunted by having fought his father to the death". His entire emotional arc is about transforming that guilt from a "haunting" into a *purpose*.

* **Reception:** He is *not* received as a hero. He finds the Osipi refugees starving, terrified, and leaderless. They are the "civilians"—elders, families, and children. They only know what Luim told them: that humans (Rovin's men) are attacking and that "traitors" (like Oji) abandoned them.
* **The Conflict:** They will see him with suspicion and anger. He is "Luim's son," the "parricide". They won't "punish" him (they are too weak), but they will *blame* him.
* **The Turning Point:** Oji's growth comes when he stops *defending* his past and starts *taking responsibility* for their future. He must prove his leadership not with words, but with action. He uses his "superhuman senses" and his "Aiki" speed—which "burns up" his own life force—to hunt for them, to find clean water, and to fight off Rovin's patrols.
* **The Growth:** He is "haunted", but he realizes his father's true "parricide" was killing his own *clan* through betrayal. Oji's act was not murder; it was an *execution* of a traitor. He internalizes that he is not his father's son; he is his people's *Cacique*. His love for Toril is his anchor—he leads his people with Toril's "Helpless Seeker" integrity, not Luim's ambition.

### Knowledge of Gorumim's "Long Game"

The refugees know *nothing* of the "long game" or the "prologue".

* They are the "dregs, lost causes" of the Osipi nation. They were pawns.
* The promise of a "Sata lifespan" was a secret Gorumim made to the *ahu* warrior elite, not to the common people.
* Oji's ahu companion, Kael, is the one who *reveals* the truth. He must explain that Luim "clan-bonded" with a "wizard" and betrayed them all for a "madness"—a lie. This is what finally wins their trust and cements their "clanless" status.

### The Locus of Irony

Oji is a powerful "locus of irony", defined by his sacrificial "half-life".

1.  **The "Good" Blood Magic:** Oji despises Gorumim's "blood magic". The irony is that his *own* blood is magical. His "Aiki blood" saved "Cricket". In his new "Cacique" role, he may be forced to do it again to save a dying Osipi child, mirroring Toril's "unweaving" sacrifice.
2.  **The "Burn Up" of Life:** The refugees were promised *long life*. The irony is that their new leader, Oji, must *shorten his own* accelerated life ("burns up") every time he uses his *aiki* power to save them.
3.  **The "Honorable" Patricide:** The greatest irony is that he had to *kill* his father to *save* his father's people. He had to become a "parricide" to become a true "Cacique."

### The Power of the Meeting ("Brother Hearts")

You are right; the "hopeless location" is the key. The meeting is just as powerful for Oji's group because *they are being actively hunted*.

* **Oji's Perspective:** He is failing. His people are freezing (their "lethal vulnerability to cold") and starving. Rovin's "war" is *real* to them, and his patrols are closing in. The "cursed" Blood Rift is his last, desperate gamble—it's **warm** (lava flows) and a place Rovin's men won't follow. He arrives there not as a proud Cacique, but as a "Helpless Seeker" leading his people to a potential grave.
* **The "Brother Hearts" Proof:** When Oji sees Toril at that *exact* spot, it is a "great magic" in itself. It's the "proof" they have "brother hearts."
    * Toril's group (exiled by Rovin) and Oji's group (hunted by Rovin) fled to the *only place on earth* that could save them *both*.
    * Toril's humans need a *refuge* from the political world. Oji's Osipi need *warmth* from the physical world. The Rift provides both.
* **The Union:** The meeting is Oji's salvation. He sees Toril, his "brother", and realizes he is no longer alone. When Toril embraces him and the **acorn glows**, it is not just Toril welcoming Oji; it is **Lin's "Heart" magic** (the acorn) blessing their union and proving their "brother hearts" were guided by the *same* "Cordimancy".
