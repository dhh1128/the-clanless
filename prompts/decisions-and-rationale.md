## Key Decisions & Thematic Rationale (The "Why")
This document summarizes the core thematic and plot decisions made for The Clanless (based on Version 8 of the synopsis), explaining the reasoning behind them.

Malena's Pregnancy: We decided to make her pregnancy magically accelerated. This was not for convenience, but for two crucial reasons: (a) It solves the novel's timeline, allowing the birth and exile to happen before the "dead of winter". (b) It re-frames the magic as a new trauma and "violation" for Malena, forcing her to reclaim her body's "alien" agency as part of her healing arc.

The Baby's Name: The baby must be a boy named Paka. This thematically links the child (originating from trauma) to Paka the man (the ultimate "cordimancer") and the acorn (Paka's "heartstone"). This act of naming transforms the child's origin from one of violence to one of "Cordimancy".

Kinora's Quest (Maco): We made the hard decision that Maco is definitively dead. A "miraculous" rescue would be "trite" and would undermine the "grounded" tone. Her arc is not finding him; it is finding the truth by confronting her abuser, "Tat". This act of speaking truth to power is what empowers her and helps her find her "voice", which she then uses as a "witness" in Sotalio.

Oji's Mission (Rovin's "Real" War): Oji's motivation must be to save "helpless" Osipi civilians. Luim's treachery (burning stores, blocking the pass) created these refugees. This is a critical plot point because their desperate raids for food are what Rovin sees as a "real war," tragically justifying his "fake war".

The Acorn vs. The Staff: The Staff of Kelun must be confiscated by Rovin at the moment of exile. The acorn (Paka's "heartstone") must activate at the exact moment the two "Clanless" groups (Toril's and Oji's) unite. This symbolizes the novel's core theme: the rejection of old, political "power" (the Staff) and the birth of a new clan founded on "Heart" magic (the acorn/Cordimancy).
